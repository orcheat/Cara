`Cara` is a `virtual assistant` capable of understanding voice commands and completes tasks for the user. It has been developed using Python programming language and has come to action using `VS Code IDE` and `Jupyter Notebook`. Microsoft Eva and speech recognition module has been used as the voice of Cara and google text to speech to identify user’s voice. In the era of multitasking, Cara offers users ten different functions. Like other virtual assistants, it can recognize the user’s voice and gives the result accordingly. Starting from the most basic feature that is providing date and time to making users happy with the entertainment features. It allows users to find songs using the well-known apps “Spotify” or “YouTube Music” as well as delivering good jokes. The most used encyclopaedia that is Wikipedia is also made available in Cara. Having a hard time finding an app made easier by Cara just by writing a simple command. And finally emailing someone without even typing a letter is performed by `Cara`.  


<h3> What is the Project all about? </h3>

We have created a `virtual AI assistant` `CARA` with help 
of `Python` and Python modules. `CARA` can help users in 
performing various class of tasks without moving their
fingers. Users only have to give voice command to 
`CARA` as they are having conversation with someone in 
real life. `CARA` can also talk to users like a virtual 
friend.
  
  <h3>Why do we think our project is important?</h3>
  
  We are in the age of `AI` and the multitasking. 
Sometimes we need to multiple works at a time. 
Sometimes we want to relax our body while working. 
`CARA` is made for these things. It can help you in 
multitasking. It can entertain you, can talk to you and 
can play music for you too.
  
  <h3>How did we develop the project(methodology)?</h3>
  
  To develop `CARA` we use Python programming 
language, `VS Code IDE` and `Jupyter Notebook`. We 
used `pyaudio module` to take audio commands. We 
used `Microsoft Eva` as the voice of `CARA` and speech 
recognition module and google text to speech to identify 
the voice of user. We wrote different functions to 
perform different tasks.

<h2>Things Cara is capable of:</h2>
<h3>Surfing Made Easier</h3>

Our `virtual assistant` can listen and comprehend verbal input given by the user. It then takes the input and runs a search on `google chrome`. Via this application, it can bring the world of information to the user’s fingertips. The user will no longer have to open and search in a physical device, this virtual assistant will do it all for them.

<h3>Music That You Love</h3>
  
  Our `virtual assistant` can find the music that the user likes and can play it using `Spotify` or `YouTube`. For a music lover, this makes music searching much easier and convenient and also saves the user from the hassle of having to search for the music that he craves to listen, on his own. In a group function, this becomes much easier as anyone can direct what music to play next, instead of having to keep going back to the device every time to change the music.
  
  <h3>Apps are Our Speciality</h3>
  
  Our `virtual assistant` can visit any app installed on the user’s device as per command. It can open and access the app with ease and can show the same to its user. This is helpful when the user is busy doing something else and needs to access his device simultaneously. Imagine cleaning the house and suddenly you remember something that needs to be added to the grocery list, or maybe you are playing with your friends and you want to enjoy some music, our virtual assistant can do just that.
  
  <h3>Cherish This Moment Forever</h3>
  
  Now if there is a very special moment, don’t let it slip. Whenever the user is watching something meaningful to them at the present moment, and they want to take a `screenshot` of the screen, they can do that with the help of our `virtual assistant`. With just a `voice command`, our `virtual assistant` can take a screenshot of the current scene that the user is watching. Whether it is your favourite movie scene, an inspirational quote, or the cookie recipe that you like, we’ve got you covered.
  
  <h3>Date and Time</h3>
  
  `Cara` is capable of telling you the date and time. All you've got to do is say- " What's the date/time? " and Cara will reply and return you the current systems time(hr-min-sec) or date(dd-mm-yyyy) whatever you've asked. So there is no need to see your calendar or clock, just ask, it's that simple.
  
  <h3>Laugh with Cara</h3>
  
  Every time you feel detached due to the current situation, just go to Cara and say- "`Tell me a joke`" and `Cara` will revert with a rib-tickling joke which will make your day.
  
  <h3>Wikipedia Search is Just a Command Away</h3>
  
  `Cara` recognizes the verbal input from the user and proceeds to display the specific `Wikipedia` page the user has asked for. Researching for a project? Want to know more about something? The user will no longer have to open a browser and search.
