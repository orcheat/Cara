<h3> What is the Project all about? </h3>
<p>
We have created a virtual AI assistant CARA with help 
of Python and Python modules. CARA can help users in 
performing various class of tasks without moving their
fingers. Users only have to give voice command to 
CARA as they are having conversation with someone in 
real life. CARA can also talk to users like a virtual 
friend.

  <h3>Why do we think your project is important?</h3>
  <p>
  We are in the age of AI and the multitasking. 
Sometimes we need to multiple works at a time. 
Sometimes we want to relax our body while working. 
CARA is made for these things. It can help you in 
multitasking. It can entertain you, can talk to you and 
can play music for you too.
  </p>
  <h3>How did we develop the project(methodology)?</h3>
  <p>
  To develop CARA we use Python programming 
language, VS Code IDE and Jupyter Notebook. We 
used pyaudio module to take audio commands. We 
used Microsoft Eva as the voice of CARA and speech 
recognition module and google text to speech to identify 
the voice of user. We wrote different functions to 
perform different tasks
